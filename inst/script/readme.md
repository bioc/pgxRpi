The "example.pgxseg" dataset serves as a toy data illustration. The ".pgxseg" data format, used in the Progenetix database, is a specialized version of a standard tab-separated columnar text file. It is commonly generated by array or sequencing CNV software. This format includes an optional metadata header that includes instructions for tasks such as plotting or grouping. More details about this data format can be found in the documentation available at https://docs.progenetix.org/file-formats/?h=.pgxseg#progenetix-file-formats.
