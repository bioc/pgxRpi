The "example.pgxseg" dataset serves as a toy data illustration. The ".pgxseg" data format, used in the Progenetix database, is a specialized version of a standard tab-separated columnar text file. It is commonly generated by array or sequencing CNV software. This format includes an optional metadata header that includes instructions for tasks such as plotting or grouping. More details about this data format can be found in the documentation available at https://docs.progenetix.org/file-formats/?h=.pgxseg#progenetix-file-formats.

The data "hg19.rda" and "hg38.rda" contain cytoband annotation details extracted from the hg19 and hg38 genomes, respectively. These annotations are sourced from https://genome.ucsc.edu/. They are generated by the cytoband.R script.

The data "hg19_bins.rda" and "hg38_bins.rda" contain information about the locations of 1MB-size bins within the hg19 and hg38 genomes, respectively. These data sets are also sourced from https://genome.ucsc.edu/. They are generated by the genomic_bins.R script.
